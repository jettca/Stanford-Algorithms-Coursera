Algorithms from Stanford's Coursera Course
===========================================

My solutions to various problems from Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms: Design and Analysis
course offered by Stanford through Coursera, taken during the winter of 2012-2013.
The algorithms were coded in C++ using Xcode, for which the project files are included.
